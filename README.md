### A Strategy Game about Battle
* Introduction of the game
	* This is a small strategic game about fighting. At the beginning, both sides have one general and ten soldiers. Generals have attributes such as blood value, attack power, defense power, intelligence value, command power, and money. Both sides of the game can set initial values for themselves. The condition of victory is who kills the other general, which means the blood value is less than or equal to zero.
